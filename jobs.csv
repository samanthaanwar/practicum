U.S. Department of Energy (DOE),Science Undergraduate Laboratory Internships (SULI),Paid,Unspecified,Undergraduate,Energy,https://science.osti.gov/wdts/suli,"Are you an undergraduate student or recent graduate who is ready to use your major in a Science, Technology, Engineering, and Math (STEM) field or science policy to help make a difference in the world? Then the Science Undergraduate Laboratory Internship (SULI) is for you!

When you join SULI, you’ll be part of a Department of Energy (DOE) team that’s working together to advance scientific impact and discovery. Expand your skills and knowledge at a DOE national laboratory using state-of-the-art facilities and advanced scientific instruments.

Each year, students from around the country participate in SULI at one of the 17 participating DOE laboratories/facilities. In this comprehensive internship, you’ll be mentored by a leading science expert who will guide you in a specific research area to gain maximum exposure to one of the many science and technology areas that underpin the U.S. Department of Energy’s (DOE’s) diverse missions. This is an opportunity for you to enhance your professional network and develop your interests in state-of-the-art research facilities and to enhance your professional network.

SULI is a paid internship opportunity sponsored and managed by the DOE Office of Science’s Office of Workforce Development for Teachers and Scientists (WDTS) in collaboration with DOE laboratories/facilities. Students can participate in SULI either in a 10-week summer internship (May–August) or in a semester-long experience (August–December or January–May)."
